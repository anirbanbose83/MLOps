# 🏡 House Price Prediction – MLflow + Streamlit MLOps Project

A modular, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting California house prices. This project demonstrates **model training**, **MLflow tracking and registry**, and a **Streamlit interface** to serve predictions.

## 📌 Features

- 🔁 Modular design with clean separation of concerns
- 📊 MLflow for experiment tracking, model versioning, and logging
- 🎯 Random Forest with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- 🖥️ Streamlit app for real-time prediction
- ✅ Supports reproducibility, extensibility, and production-ready structure


## 🧠 The Problem: Predicting House Prices

We use the California Housing Dataset to predict median house prices based on input features like median income, age, location, and occupancy. The objective is to minimize prediction error using effective hyperparameter tuning.


## 🔍 Why Experiment Tracking Matters

ML projects often involve:
- Multiple model iterations
- Different hyperparameters
- Performance comparisons

MLflow enables:
- Easy **tracking** of parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- Clear **versioning** of trained models
- Better **collaboration** with reproducible results


## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone & Navigate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house_price_mlflow.git
cd house_price_mlflow
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Windows PowerShell)
Create venv
```bash
& "C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe" -m venv venv
```

Activate venv
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture
1. Data Loading: project/data_loader.py
2. Hyperparameter Tuning: project/model_utils.py with GridSearchCV
3. MLflow Logging: Parameters, MSE, and model artifacts
4. Model Registry: Latest version is registered under Best Randomforest Model
5. Serving: Streamlit app loads the latest registered model for predictions

## 🚀 Running the Project
### 1. Run the ML Pipeline
python main_pipeline.py

This will:
- Split the data
- Train a RandomForest model
- Log metrics, params, and model with MLflow
- Register the latest version of the model

### 2. Launch the Streamlit App
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

Interact with the model using a user-friendly web UI.


## 📦 Reproducibility and Collaboration
- All experiment metadata is saved in mlruns/
- main_pipeline.py ensures consistent data splits and signatures
- Registered models can be version-controlled and shared with teams

## 🧬 Model Versioning: Beyond Just Logging
Instead of just saving models:
- We register each successful model version
- The Streamlit app dynamically pulls the latest model version using MlflowClient
- No manual path handling or run ID tracking needed

## ✅ Final Thoughts
This project can easily be extended to:
- Add more model types (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Use a central MLflow server
- Integrate with CI/CD for production deployment
- Perfect starting point for robust ML model lifecycle management in real-world use cases.
